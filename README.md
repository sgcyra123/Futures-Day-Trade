# Futures-Day-Trade
Backtester, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Implementation on Interactive Brokers. 

Welcome to the backtester I created which helped me create a stock index futures intraday momentum trading strategy.
The strategy is quite simple and has had good performance over a 15 year period regardless of the exact parameters used. 
The strategy trades YM and NQ futures and within the first half hour of trading, buying whichever one has outperformed the other since the previous day's close, and
shorts the other in a corresponding quantity, adjusted for volatility. Thanks for looking!
