# Futures-Day-Trade
Backtester, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Implementation on Interactive Brokers. 

Thank you for your interest in my systematic stock-index trend-following day trade!
The strategy is quite simple and has had good performance over a 15 year period regardless of the exact parameters used. 
The strategy trades YM and NQ futures within the first half hour of trading, buying whichever one has outperformed the other since the previous day's close, and
shorts the other in a corresponding quantity, adjusted for volatility.
