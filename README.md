# Futures-Day-Trade
Backtester, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Implementation on Interactive Brokers. 

Thank you for your interest in my systematic stock-index trend-following day trade! This is for historical research reference only.
The strategy trades YM and NQ futures within the first half hour of trading, buying whichever one has outperformed the other since the previous day's close, and
shorts the other in a corresponding quantity, adjusted for volatility.
